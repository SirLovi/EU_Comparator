# EU_Comparator
App that compares votes of different parliament members in European Parliament.

## Running the application

1. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Start the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. Use the sidebar to select up to six Members of the European Parliament. You can
   optionally focus on main votes only. The main panel summarises how often they
   voted the same way, shows a pairwise agreement overview, and lists each shared
   vote alongside the individual positions.
